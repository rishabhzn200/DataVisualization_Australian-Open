User can interact with the visualization by hovering the mouse over the circles.
2. Arrows: Once the circle is selected the arrow pops up. These arrows have a head and a tail. The head points to the player who lost and the tail points to the winner.

The number of arrows going out of a particular player gives the level the player reached in that year and the arrow which points towards the selected player shows he lost that particular match. All the players, except the winner, will have one arrow pointing towards him.
